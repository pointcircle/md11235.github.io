#+TITLE: Android sdk manager command line operations

copied from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17963508/how-to-install-android-sdk-build-tools-on-the-command-line

By default, the SDK Manager from the command line does not include the build tools in the list. They're in the "obsolete" category. To see all available downloads, use

android list sdk --all

And then to get one of the packages in that list from the command line, use:

android update sdk -u -a -t <package no.>

Where -u stands for --no-ui, -a stands for --all and -t stands for --filter.

If you need to install multiple packages do:

android update sdk -u -a -t 1,2,3,4,..,n 

Where 1,2,..,n is the package number listed with the list command above
